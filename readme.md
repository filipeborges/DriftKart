This repository is intended for "Projeto Integrador 2", a discipline from Software Engineering course from University of Bras√≠lia. This project is called "Drifting Kart", which is basically a small Kart with some unique functionality. 

This is an Android application which will display information about the Kart, like speed, battery drain and time left to recharge the battery. The information displayed need to be better defined.
